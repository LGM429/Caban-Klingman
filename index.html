				Queens City Councilmember Tiffany Cabán, Democrat, decidedly defended her seat against Republican Challenger Kelly Klingman earlier this month. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Cabán, a member of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), outspent Klingman, a self-styled Reagan moderate, almost three to one, <a href=https://www.nyccfb.info/FTMSearch/Candidates/Expenditures?ec=2023&cand=2436 target="_blank">according to public figures.</a> Cabán received close to 70% of the vote—a few percentage points better than her last election in 2021.
			</p>
            <p> 
                Cabán's reelection comes at a time when DSA politicians have come under fire from some Democrats for their stance on the Israel-Hamas War.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The DSA has made itself radioactive in New York politics,” Democratic Congressman Ritchie Torres told <a href=https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/28/middle-east-conflict-new-york-city-00124046 target="_blank">Politico in October</a>, just weeks before elections were held. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Movers in the City's GOP have also put DSA members in their crosshairs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the spring, 2021 GOP mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa <a href=https://nypost.com/2023/02/21/gop-moves-in-on-queens-socialist-turf-to-challenge-aoc-tiffany-caban/ target="_blank">spearheaded</a> the creation of Ronald Reagan Republican Club in Astoria to challenge progressives and democratic socialists like Cabán and AOC by allying with moderates.

				In Astoria, Klingman, a real estate agent, had hoped to garner voters from conservatives, moderates and Democrats who found Cabán’s policies too far left. Debbie Rigas, a liberal voter, said she supported Klingman because Cabán had not been effective addressing quality-of-life issues. “She’s not visible,” Rigas said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a phone interview as early voting opened, Klingman said that out of 100,000 registered voters in the district, 64,000 are Democrats. Of those, 75% are moderate, “old-school, Kennedy Democrats,” said Klingman. “They don’t like either fringe.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                Klingman was unsuccessful in her aim to build a broad coalition. The Cabán campaign outraised her more than three to one, leaning heavily on out-of-district donations.
            </p>
            <p>
                John Krinsky, a political science professor at City College, said he did not see this as a competitive council race. “Progressives are fairly strong in their districts,” he said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This election cycle there were almost 7000 fewer votes cast in District 22 <a href=https://ballotpedia.org/Tiffany_Cab%C3%A1n#2021 target="_blank">compared to 2021,</a> the last time the City Council elections were held.
